ðŸ“Œ DrumScribe : Development of a Machine Learning Model to Automatically Transcribe Drum Audio
As a drummer, I often struggle with transcribing songs in timeâ€”especially when I want to jam with a band. So, I developed a machine learning model that automatically transcribes drum audio into drum notation.

ðŸš€ Results
âœ… Achieved 96.2% accuracy
âœ… Transcription is 4x faster than a human
âœ… Capable of transcribing popular songs accurately

ðŸ“‚ The main idea of the project is to process drum audio into spectrogram images, then use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) â€” specifically a pre-trained model like ResNet50 â€” to classify the images into drum notations.
